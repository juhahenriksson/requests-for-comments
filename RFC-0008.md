# Motivation

Defining licenses to preserve intellectual property rights (regulating data acquisition, sharing and publishing) and to sustain the interoperability and accessibility of the TM. 

# General Principles

According to the Open Data (OD) Directive (2019/1024)[^eur-lex3], open access to information and the right to knowledge are fundamental rights. Where digital cultural heritage is concerned, unless the use or availability of material or metadata is restricted by law, contract or ethical reason, it should be freely available for re-use.

European Commission recommendation on a common European data space for cultural heritage (2021/1970)[^eur-lex4] declares that Member States should ensure that data resulting from publicly funded digitisation projects become and stay findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (‘FAIR principles’[^go-fair]) through digital infrastructures (including the data space) to accelerate data sharing. Furthermore, article 14 of the DSM directive (2019/790)[^eur-lex2] states that when the term of protection of a work of visual art has expired, any material resulting from an act of reproduction of that work is not subject to copyright or related rights, unless the material resulting from that act of reproduction is original in the sense that it is the author's own intellectual creation.

It is highly recommended that restrictions on use and availability are distinguished. Rights holders should be expressed as unambiguously as possible. The metadata should also include necessary time limits and dates related to intellectual property rights, and these should be stated unambiguously and in accordance with the standards.

The exact subject of the use restrictions should be as unambiguous and clear as possible (e.g., metadata, the entire collection, the material, or some individual information in the metadata or material, or a specific instance of the material).

The OD Directive states that when the reuse of a document is subject to conditions the use of standard licenses is recommended. A standard licence is defined in the OD Directive as “a set of predefined reuse conditions in a digital format, preferably compatible with standardised public licences available online”. Thus, licences should be identified with URIs, which should resolve to the description of the licence[^ec]. If a local or national licence is used, its description should link to a well-known licence on which it is based. 

 “European Commission’s guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the reuse of documents”[^eur-lex1] regulates the use licences. In. addition, according to the “Decision of 22.2.2019 adopting Creative Commons as an open licence under the European Commission’s reuse policy”[^ec], the European Commission has adopted “Creative Commons – Attribution BY” as an open license for the Commission’s reuse policy. In addition, the Decision states that, “without prejudice to the preceding article, raw data, metadata or other documents of comparable nature may alternatively be distributed under the provisions of the Creative Commons Universal Public Domain Dedication deed (CC0 1.0)”.

# Europeana Licensing Framework

For licensing, Time Machine recommends to follow the Europeana Licencing framework if possible[^pro4]. 
Europeana uses 14 standardised rights statements[^pro3]:
- Six Creative Commons[^creative] Licences
- Two Creative Commons Tools
- Six out of the twelve Rights Statements[^rights]

Europeana encourages the use of Creative Commons Licences and Tools as much as possible to facilitate the reuse of digital cultural heritage. When they are not suitable, for example because the providing institution cannot legally apply them, Rights Statements by the Rights Statements Consortium should be used. A cultural heritage institution can only apply a CC licence if it holds all of the rights.

Europeana's instructions may be followed to select the appropriate license[^pro5][^pro1]. A flowchart has been developed to facilitate selection[^pro2]. 

Europeana uses two Creative Commons tools. These should be used on works that are in the public domain or that want to be dedicated to the public domain.

- The Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0)
- The Public Domain Mark (PDM)

Europeana recommends that Creative Commons Licences should be applied to works that are in copyright and for which the rightsholder wants to authorise some reuse. The six Creative Commons Licences that Europeana uses are:

- Creative Commons - Attribution (BY)
- Creative Commons - Attribution, ShareAlike (BY-SA)
- Creative Commons - Attribution, No Derivatives (BY-ND)
- Creative Commons - Attribution, Non-Commercial (BY-NC)
- Creative Commons - Attribution, Non-Commercial, ShareAlike (BY-NC-SA)
- Creative Commons - Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivatives (BY-NC-ND)

Right Statements were designed to complement Creative Commons Licences. Only when CC licenses are not suitable for a specific situation, Rights Statements may be used. It should be noted that Rights Statements are not licences. 

The six Rights Staments that Europeana uses are:

- No Copyright - non commercial re-use only (NoC-NC)
- No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restriction (NoC-OKLR)
- In Copyright (InC)
- In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted (InC-EDU)
- In Copyright - EU Orphan Work (InC-OW-EU)
- Copyright Not Evaluated (CNE)


# Licences for Indigenous Cultural Heritage

The Europeana Licensing framework may not be suitable when licencing ingenous cultural heritage. Instead, the Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels may be used[^local]. Labels are digital markers that define attribution, access, and use rights for Indigenous cultural heritage. Twenty TK Labels have been developed through direct community partnership and collaboration. Each TK Label can be adapted and customized to reflect ongoing relationships and authority including proper use, guidelines for action, or responsible stewardship and re-use.

Provenance Labels identify the group or sub-group which is the primary cultural authority for the material, and/or recognizes other interest in the materials. Provenance Labels are TK Attribution (TK A), TK Clan (TK CL), TK Family (TK F), TK Multiple Communities (TK MC), TK Community Voice (TK CV), and TK Creative (TK CR).

Protocol Labels outline traditional protocols associated with access to this material and invite viewers to respect community protocols. Protocol Labels are TK Verified (TK V), TK Non-Verified (TK NV), TK Seasonal (TK S), TK Women General (TK WG), TK Men General (TK MG), TK Men Restricted (TK MR), TK Women Restricted (TK WR), TK Cultural Sensitive (TK CS), and TK Secret / Sacred (TK SS).

Permission Labels indicate what activities the community has approved as generally acceptable. Other uses require direct engagement with primary cultural authorities. Permission Labels are TK Open to Commercalization (TK OC), TK Non-Commercial (TK NC), TK Community Use Only (TK CO), TK Outreach (TK O), and TK Open to Collaboration (TK CB).
